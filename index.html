<h1>Aniruddh Anand Personal Website</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
Hi! I'm Ani a student at The University of Texas at Austin in the CSB Honors
Program. I am not a big fan of personal websites because they all seem to be the
same react/next.js templates over and over again ... and i am pretty bad at
website design. I prefer spending my time either working on personal projects or
enjoying the world. 

<h2>Why?</h2>
I just said I dislike such websites, so why do I have this:
Well I saw some of the of the most brilliant computer scientists do maintain
personal websites, just save time but keeping it very basic. It seems in this
day and age going back to basics is the new modern!

<h2>Interests:</h2>
<p>I like computer architecture, systems, and distributed systems!
Oh also a big nba fan, I used to watch anime, but nowadays read more light
novels and korean web novels: I recomend going to naver novels and just
translating the page to english if you want to read korean web novels, plus the
naver webcomics are usually pay walled and have korean national restrictions.</p>

I have also been getting into reading and understanding संस्कृतम् to connect more
with the culture and interpret all our santhani texts for myself. I feel our
culture has so much fear from conversion and colonization that we as hindu's
aren't provided with a sufficient hindu education. This leads to more misbelifs
and conflictions between cultural, religious, and philosphical values.

<h2>Current Projects:</h2>
<p>- I am writting my own <a href=https://github.com/aniruddhanand/raft/> distributed key
 value store</a>in rust. So please check it out!</p>
<p>- Also Recomendations are always welcome</p>
<p>- This website too is a ongoing project. I will try to update it as I go. If
you find the github page for this feel free to witness the greating piece of
html trash!</p>

<h2>Contact:</h2>
<p>*This is super cool in my opinion replacing the dots and ats so the bots don't
spam you*</p>
